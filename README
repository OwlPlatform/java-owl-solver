== About ==

  The Solver-Aggregator library is an implementation of the GRAIL
  Solver-Aggregator network protocol for the Java language.  It provides the
  ability for a Java application to receive streams of sample data from 
  Owl Platform aggregators.  Using a publication-subscription (pub/sub) model,
  applications can receive only the data they want.

== Compiling ==

  This library should be compiled using the Apache Maven project management
  tool.  The project is currently compatible with Apache Maven version 3,
  which can be downloaded for free at <http://maven.apache.org/>.  To build
  the static JAR file output, the following command should be run from the
  project root (where the pom.xml file is located):

    mvn clean package -U

  If everything compiles correctly, then near the end of the Maven output,
  this line should appear:

    [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS

  In this case, the JAR file will be located in the ``target'' subdirectory.
  If not, please visit the project website listed at the top of this
  document for support.
